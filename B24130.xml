            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat <hi>Oliver</hi> late pretended Protector thirsting after Innocent Blood, did, in <hi>May</hi> 1658. by the Advice of his Council, contrary to the known fundamental Lawes of the Land (whereto every Free-born English-man hath an inherent Birth-right, and according to which Laws the said Bloody Tyrannical pretended Protector at his Installment swore to Governe the three Kingdomes) erect a High Court of Justice (or rather Injustice) to try several persons for supposed Crimes against the said pretended Protector, Whereof he appointed <hi>John Lisle</hi> Esq; President.</p>
            <p>That your Petitioners late husband, <hi>Doctor John Hewytt,</hi> being in <hi>June</hi> next following convened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the said Court, was by the said <hi>John Lisle,</hi> and divers others that sate with him accused of Treason with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Presentment or Indictment, and contrary to the Tenour of the Commission (granted them) authorizing them to proceed according to Justice, which hath alwayes been interpreted according to the known Laws.</p>
            <p>That your Petitioners said husband protesting his Innocency to the death, humbly desiring to be tryed by God and his Countrey, offered to plead to any such Indictment as the Judges of the Land (who were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Commissioners in the said Commission, but refused to act) should declare to be Legall, or according to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Act of Parliament; And therefore appealed to their Judgement, whether he, being an English-man, was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise bound to plead, there being no Act at that time in being, to constitute any High Court of Justice to try any man otherwise then by the ancient known Laws.</p>
            <p>That all the Judges refusing to fit and joyne in any such proceeding; The said <hi>John Lisle,</hi> did, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, without Jury or Witness produced, sentence your Petitioners said husband to death, and caused him to be Executed as a Traytor upon <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> To the unspeakable grief, and irreparable losse of your deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Petitioner and her fatherlesse children, and in the consequence of it, to the subversion of all Law, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Liberty.</p>
            <p>Your Petitioner therefore humbly prayeth your Honours (out of an inflamed zeal to publick Justice, Law, and the peoples Liberties) and for the future to deterre others from the like horrid, bloody, arbitrary and detestable proceedings, as the effusion of Innocent Christian Blood, which cries aloud for vengeance; to order that the said <hi>John Lisle</hi> may be speedily brought to exemplary Justice, and that he may be (as a Murtherer) excepted from pardon in the Act of Oblivion; And that the other Commissioners who sate and acted with him, (to wit) Alderman <hi>Tichborne,</hi> Alderman <hi>Ireton,</hi> Alderman <hi>Pack,</hi>Serjeant <hi>Crook, John Barkstead</hi> and <hi>John Phelpes,</hi> and the rest may be ordered to give her such due reparations for her damages sustained by the Execution of her said husband, as your Honours shall conceive fit.</p>
            <closer>And your Petitioner shall ever Pray.</closer>
